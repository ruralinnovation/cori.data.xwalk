Hence they are two conditions to motivate change in county boundary: 

  - change affectiing an estimated population of 200 or more
  
  - change affecting unpopulated territory of at least 10 square miles
  
If changes exist but do not match one of those conditions they will not be implemented. 

The older boundaries it seems we can get from Census is 1992.

It is unclear how were the county in the 60'.
