Hence they are two conditions to motivate change in county boundary: 

  - change affectiing an estimated population of 200 or more
  
  - change affecting unpopulated territory of at least 10 square miles

If changes exist but do not match one of those conditions they will not be implemented. 

The US census is providing a list of change starting in 1970 and update it every decade. 

## 1960

It is unclear how were the county in the 60'. 
We can check this [file](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/1960/historical-delineation-files/60mfips.txt)

### Data and software:

The older boundaries it seems we can get from Census is 1992.
They can be find here: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER1992/ and are in the original TIGER/LINE format (GDAL has driver for it). Sadly some works need to be done to convert those LINEs into a merged polygones for census county boundary. GDAL used to come with `tigerpoly.py` for that (see: https://gdal.org/en/latest/api/python_samples.html#python-samples).  

> The TIGER/Line coordinate system is hardcoded to NAD83 lat/long degrees.


## 2000

## 2010

Connecticut's Councils of Governments (COGs) are County Equivalent Entities (See [link](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/ct_county_equiv_change.pdf)).

## Summary:

So far the options are:

- a county has been fully incorporated in an other one 
- a county has been partially incorporated in multiple?

The US Census utilize this way to describe those changes: 

- Changes to counties or County Equivalent Entities

- Deleted counties or County Equivalent Entities

- New Counties or County Equivalent Entities

- Substantial County or County Equivalent Entity Boundary Changes

- Name and/or Code Changes or Corrections for Counties or County Equivalent Entities (Ex LaSalle -> La Salle)
